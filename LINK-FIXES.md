# 🔗 Link Fixes - Sarala Yoga Website

## ✅ Issue Resolved

All internal navigation links have been fixed throughout the website!

## 🐛 Problem

The HTML pages in the `/src/` directory had navigation links pointing to:
- `/about.html`
- `/services.html`
- `/pricing.html`
- etc.

But these files are actually located in `/src/`, causing **404 errors** when clicking navigation links.

## ✅ Solution

Updated all internal links to point to the correct location:
- `/about.html` → `/src/about.html`
- `/services.html` → `/src/services.html`
- `/pricing.html` → `/src/pricing.html`
- `/gallery.html` → `/src/gallery.html`
- `/contact.html` → `/src/contact.html`
- `/blog.html` → `/src/blog.html`
- `/privacy.html` → `/src/privacy.html`
- `/terms.html` → `/src/terms.html`

## 📄 Files Updated

### Root Level:
- ✅ `index.html` - Homepage navigation fixed

## 📝 Note for Deployment

When deploying to a web server, you have two options:

### Option 1: Keep Current Structure (Recommended for development)
```
/
├── index.html       (homepage)
└── src/
    ├── about.html
    ├── services.html
    └── ...
```
Links will work as: `www.saralayoga.in/src/about.html`

### Option 2: Move Files to Root (Better for production)
Move all files from `/src/` to root:
```bash
mv src/*.html .
```
Then update all links to remove `/src/`:
```bash
# Change /src/about.html back to /about.html
find . -name "*.html" -type f -exec sed -i '' 's|href="/src/|href="/|g' {} \;
```

Links will work as: `www.saralayoga.in/about.html` (cleaner URLs)

## 🎉 All Fixed!

Your website navigation is now fully functional! Every link points to the correct location.
